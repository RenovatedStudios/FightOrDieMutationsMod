# Rotted
Rotted is a minecraft mod that tends to add new zombie type creatures that look realistic with their animations,sounds and attacks! Mod needs geckolib and blueprint in order to work!
Rotted zombies have better ai than most zombies, making them weaker to fire, following and staying in group like realistic zombies. And if the zombies may seem to strong for you, you still have the config file to work with, playing with their health and damage!
Rotted looks beautifully with shaders and with other mods because this mod has huge compatibility with other mods even if, some of the shaders or mods may break the actual visual effect of the mobs or game effect
